#Sarcastic Blackjack
###My first Python game

This game takes a traditional Blackjack engine and layers entertaining features:
1. Scenario-specific quips from the dealer, based on both player's decision making and on outcomes.
2. Narrative to enhance user engagement.

From the game.....

>This dealer needs to go, and you're the one who can get her fired!
The Whipperwill Truck-Stop/Dinner-Theatre/Casino in Bugtussle, KY has one mean Blackjack dealer. You and the other patrons have had enough of her salty one-liners. Time to get her fired. So here's the plan: Other patrons will spread a rumor for management to catch wind of -- that she's off her rocker and paying out too much for winning hands (she isn't). Double your bankroll to $500, and the management will surely cut her loose. Good luck! This game is rated PG-13.
